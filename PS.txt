Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence
Theme: "Connect What Matters — For the User Who Matters"

CHALLENGE BRIEF

You will build a system that acts as an intelligent document analyst, extracting and prioritizing the most relevant sections from a collection of documents based on a specific persona and their job-to-be-done.

INPUT SPECIFICATION

1. Document Collection: 3-10 related PDFs
2. Persona Definition: Role description with specific expertise and focus areas  
3. Job-to-be-Done: Concrete task the persona needs to accomplish

REQUIREMENTS FOR GENERALIZATION

Document collection, persona and job-to-be-done can be very diverse. So, the solution that teams need to build needs to be generic to generalize to this variety.

• Documents can be from any domain (Examples: Research papers, school/college books, financial reports, news articles etc.)
• Persona can again be very diverse (Examples: Researcher, Student, Salesperson, Journalist, Entrepreneur etc)
• Job-to-be-done: This will be related to the persona (Examples: Provide a literature review for a given topic and available research papers, What should I study for Organic Chemistry given the chemistry documents, Summarize the financials of corporation xyz given the detailed year end financial reports etc.)

SAMPLE TEST CASES

Test Case 1: Academic Research
• Documents: 4 research papers on "Graph Neural Networks for Drug Discovery"
• Persona: PhD Researcher in Computational Biology
• Job: "Prepare a comprehensive literature review focusing on methodologies, datasets, and performance benchmarks"

Test Case 2: Business Analysis
• Documents: 3 annual reports from competing tech companies (2022-2024)
• Persona: Investment Analyst
• Job: "Analyze revenue trends, R&D investments, and market positioning strategies"

Test Case 3: Educational Content
• Documents: 5 chapters from organic chemistry textbooks
• Persona: Undergraduate Chemistry Student
• Job: "Identify key concepts and mechanisms for exam preparation on reaction kinetics"

REQUIRED OUTPUT

Output JSON format: Refer challenge1b_output.json

The output should contain:
1. Metadata:
   a. Input documents
   b. Persona
   c. Job to be done
   d. Processing timestamp

2. Extracted Section:
   a. Document
   b. Page number
   c. Section title
   d. Importance_rank

3. Sub-section Analysis:
   a. Document
   b. Page Number
   c. Refined Text
   d. Importance_rank

CONSTRAINTS

• Must run on CPU only
• Model size ≤ 1GB
• Processing time ≤ 60 seconds for document collection (3-5 documents)
• No internet access allowed during execution

DELIVERABLES

• approach_explanation.md (300-500 words explaining methodology)
• Dockerfile and execution instructions
• Sample input/output for testing

SCORING CRITERIA

Criteria                    Max Points    Description
